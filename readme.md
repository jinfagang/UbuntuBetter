# Ubuntu Better

Make ubuntu more beautiful and better to use. Here contains many ubuntu theme and icons and many other setups. But only from my aesthetic.

First install tweaks tool first:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
```



## theme

the best theme I know from now is `gnome-osc-themes`, you can find it at:

```
https://github.com/paullinuxthemer/gnome-osc-themes
```

Clone it and mv the theme into `/usr/share/themes`, then you can found it in Tweaks tool.



## icons



## shell



## dock



## login screen
